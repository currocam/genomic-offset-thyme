## Genos01_02_2024

- Genotypes in plink binary format (pilot). 1342 SNPs and 233 samples.  Made by Genis. Genotypes from enriched genes (exons and variants in introngs when sequencing high enough). Filtered by, a) variants with minor frequency > 0.1, b) removed variants with genotypes missingness rate > 0.05, c) individuals with genotype missingness rate > 0.1, and LD pruning of variants with a r2 threshold of 0.1 (so it removes one from each pair of variants with r2 of 0.1).

- Ecological predictors (pilot). The 21 localities are the ones indicated in the column “site_id”.
